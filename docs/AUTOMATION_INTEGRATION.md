## ‚è∞ Cron Job Configuration

### Recommended Schedule

| Automation System | Schedule | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Weekly Service Creation | `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9 AM |
| Employee Recruitment | `0 10 * * 2` | Every Tuesday at 10 AM |

| Business Intelligence | `0 8 * * 6` | Every Saturday at 8 AM |
| Employee Payouts | `0 12 * * 5` | Every Friday at 12 PM |

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Traditional Cron (Linux/Unix)
```bash
# Add to your crontab
0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/create-weekly-services"
0 10 * * 2 curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/automated-employee-recruitment"
0 11 * * 3 curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/automated-customer-acquisition"
0 8 * * 6 curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/business-intelligence"
0 12 * * 5 curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-employee-payouts"
```

#### Option 2: Vercel Cron Jobs
Add to your `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/create-weekly-services",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * 1"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/automated-employee-recruitment",
      "schedule": "0 10 * * 2"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/automated-customer-acquisition",
      "schedule": "0 11 * * 3"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/business-intelligence",
      "schedule": "0 8 * * 6"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-employee-payouts",
      "schedule": "0 12 * * 5"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option 3: GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/automation.yml`:
```yaml
name: ScoopifyClub Automation

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly services
    - cron: '0 10 * * 2' # Employee recruitment
    - cron: '0 11 * * 3' # Customer acquisition
    - cron: '0 8 * * 6'  # Business intelligence
    - cron: '0 12 * * 5' # Employee payouts

jobs:
  automation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger automation
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/cron/${{ github.event.schedule }}"
```

## üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

### Automated Health Check
Run the generated health check script:
```bash
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### Manual Health Check
```bash
# Check automation status
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/automation-status

# Check system metrics
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/system-metrics

# Check recent activity
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/recent-activity?limit=10
```

### Dashboard Monitoring
- Visit `/admin/dashboard/automation` regularly
- Check the "System Overview" tab for any alerts
- Review "Recent Activity" for automation performance
- Use "Business Analytics" to track growth trends

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Environment Variables
Add these to your production environment:
```bash
# Automation Settings
AUTOMATION_ENABLED=true
RECRUITMENT_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=true
ACQUISITION_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=true
BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=true

# External Service APIs (optional)
INDEED_API_KEY=your-indeed-api-key
FACEBOOK_ADS_API_KEY=your-facebook-ads-api-key
GOOGLE_ADS_API_KEY=your-google-ads-api-key
```

### Customizing Automation Logic
The automation systems are designed to be easily customizable:

1. **Employee Recruitment**: Modify `src/app/api/cron/automated-employee-recruitment/route.js`
2. **Customer Acquisition**: Modify `src/app/api/cron/automated-customer-acquisition/route.js`
3. **Business Intelligence**: Modify `src/app/api/cron/business-intelligence/route.js`

### Adding New Automation Types
1. Create a new cron job endpoint
2. Add it to the automation status API
3. Update the AutomationDashboard component
4. Add it to the trigger automation API

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Automation Not Running
1. Check cron job configuration
2. Verify endpoint URLs are correct
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Test manual triggers from dashboard

#### Dashboard Not Loading
1. Verify authentication is working
2. Check API endpoints are accessible
3. Review browser console for errors
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed

#### Data Not Updating
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify Prisma client is up to date
3. Review API response logs
4. Test individual API endpoints

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Support
- Check the `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` for system status
- Review server logs for detailed error information
- Test individual automation endpoints manually
- Use the health check script to diagnose issues

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Ensure proper indexes on frequently queried fields
- Monitor query performance in production
- Consider read replicas for heavy analytics queries

### API Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Consider background job processing for heavy operations

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for automation failures
- Monitor system resource usage
- Track automation performance metrics
- Set up error reporting (e.g., Sentry)

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one automation system and gradually add others
2. **Monitor Closely**: Check the dashboard regularly during initial deployment
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Use manual triggers to test automation logic
4. **Backup Data**: Ensure database backups before major automation changes
5. **Document Changes**: Keep track of any customizations made to automation logic

## üéâ Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure automation success:

- **Employee Recruitment**: Time to fill coverage gaps, application quality
- **Customer Acquisition**: Lead conversion rates, cost per acquisition
- **Business Intelligence**: Report accuracy, actionable insights generated
- **Overall**: System uptime, automation success rate, manual intervention required
