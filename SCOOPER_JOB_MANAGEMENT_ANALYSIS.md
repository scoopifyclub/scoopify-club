## Issues Found and Fixed

### ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**
1. **Variable Name Mismatch in Scooping Page**
   - **Issue**: `handleClaimService` used `id` instead of `serviceId` in API call
   - **Fix**: Corrected variable reference in fetch URL
   - **Location**: `src/app/employee/scooping/page.jsx:42`

2. **Authentication Inconsistency in Scooping Page**
   - **Issue**: Used `localStorage.getItem('token')` instead of proper auth system
   - **Fix**: Integrated with `useAuth` hook for consistent authentication
   - **Location**: `src/app/employee/scooping/page.jsx:11,37`

3. **Variable Reference Errors in Service Page**
   - **Issue**: Multiple references to undefined `id` variable instead of `serviceId`
   - **Fix**: Corrected all variable references and cleaned up TypeScript artifacts
   - **Location**: `src/app/employee/services/[id]/page.jsx:25,35,45,65`

### ðŸ”§ **MINOR IMPROVEMENTS MADE**
1. **API Response Handling**: Updated to handle both `data.services` and `data` response formats
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback
3. **Code Cleanup**: Removed TypeScript compilation artifacts and improved readability
