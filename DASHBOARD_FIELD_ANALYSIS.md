# üöÄ Dashboard Field Analysis - Database Schema Mismatches

## Overview
This document identifies field mismatches between the dashboard components and the actual database schema, which are causing the 500 errors and authentication issues.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Customer Payments API - Missing Field (FIXED)
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/payments/route.js:140`
**Issue:** Trying to access `paymentMethodId` field that doesn't exist in Payment model
**Schema:** Payment model has `paymentMethod` (enum), not `paymentMethodId`
**Fix Applied:** Changed `paymentMethodId` to `paymentMethod`

### 2. ‚úÖ Customer Services API - Missing Field (FIXED)
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/services/route.js:140`
**Issue:** Trying to access `expiresAt` field that doesn't exist in ServicePhoto model
**Schema:** ServicePhoto model has `expiresAt` field
**Fix Applied:** Added back `expiresAt` field to the select query

### 3. ‚úÖ Customer Profile API - Field Access Mismatch (FIXED)
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/profile/route.js:40`
**Issue:** `validateUser` function not returning customer data
**Schema:** Customer model has proper relationships
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced `validateUser` function to return customer data for CUSTOMER role

### 4. ‚úÖ Customer Services API - Location Field Mismatch (FIXED)
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/services/route.js:POST`
**Issue:** Trying to use `locationId` field that doesn't exist in Service model
**Schema:** Service model has `location` relation, not `locationId`
**Fix Applied:** Updated schema to use `latitude`, `longitude`, `address` and create Location record

### 5. ‚úÖ Employee Dashboard API - Field Naming (FIXED)
**File:** `src/app/api/employee/dashboard/route.js:110`
**Issue:** Inconsistent variable naming for service areas
**Schema:** Employee model has `serviceAreas` relationship
**Fix Applied:** Standardized variable naming to use `serviceAreas` consistently

## üü° Schema Relationship Corrections

### Service Model Relationships
- **Customer:** `service.customer.User.name` ‚úÖ (Correct - uppercase User)
- **Employee:** `service.employee.User.name` ‚úÖ (Correct - uppercase User)
- **Location:** `service.location` ‚úÖ (Correct - relation, not field)

### Employee Model Relationships
- **Service Areas:** `employee.serviceAreas` ‚úÖ (Correct - CoverageArea[] relation)
- **User:** `employee.User` ‚úÖ (Correct - uppercase User)

## üîß Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced validateUser Function
**File:** `src/lib/api-auth.js`
- Added role-based validation
- Added customer data fetching for CUSTOMER role
- Returns `{ userId, role, customerId, customer }` for customers
- Maintains backward compatibility for other roles

### 2. Fixed Payment Method Field
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/payments/route.js`
- Changed `paymentMethodId` to `paymentMethod` in Payment creation

### 3. Fixed Service Location Creation
**File:** `src/app/api/customer/services/route.js`
- Updated schema to use `latitude`, `longitude`, `address`
- Fixed service creation to properly create Location record
- Added location to include query

### 4. Standardized Employee Dashboard Fields
**File:** `src/app/api/employee/dashboard/route.js`
- Fixed variable naming consistency for service areas

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues
- Customer Payments API field mismatch
- Customer Services API missing fields
- Customer Profile API authentication
- Customer Services API location creation
- Employee Dashboard API field consistency

### üîç Remaining Checks
