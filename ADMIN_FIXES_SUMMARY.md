# Admin Dashboard Prisma Relationship Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Relationship Field Names**
**Problem**: Multiple admin API routes were using lowercase `user` instead of capital `User` for Prisma relationships.

**Error Messages**:
```
Unknown field `user` for include statement on model `Customer`. Available options are marked with ?.
Unknown field `customer` for include statement on model `Service`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

**Root Cause**: The Prisma schema defines relationships with capital `User`:
- `Customer.User` (not `customer.user`)
- `Employee.User` (not `employee.user`)

### 2. **Files Fixed**:

#### `/src/app/api/admin/stats/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `customer.user` → `customer.User`
- ✅ Fixed `employee.user` → `employee.User`
- ✅ Simplified relationship queries to use proper includes

#### `/src/app/api/admin/analytics/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `customer.user` → `customer.User`
- ✅ Fixed `employee.user` → `employee.User`
- ✅ Removed invalid `customersByStatus` groupBy (Customer model has no status field)

#### `/src/app/api/admin/employees/activity/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `employee.user` → `employee.User`
- ✅ Fixed non-existent `employeeActivity` model → use `Service` model instead
- ✅ Added proper activity transformation

#### `/src/app/api/admin/employees/[employeeId]/metrics/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `customer.user` → `customer.User`

#### `/src/app/api/admin/employees/[employeeId]/service-areas/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `employee.user` → `employee.User`

#### `/src/app/api/admin/employees/[employeeId]/service-area/route.js`
- ✅ Fixed `employee.user` → `employee.User`

### 3. **Schema Validation Issues Fixed**

#### **Non-existent Models**:
- ❌ `employeeActivity` model doesn't exist in schema
- ✅ Replaced with `Service` model queries filtered by `employeeId`

#### **Invalid GroupBy Fields**:
- ❌ `Customer` model has no `status` field
- ✅ Removed `customersByStatus` groupBy query
- ✅ Kept `Employee.status` and `Service.status` groupBy (valid fields)

### 4. **Correct Schema Relationships**

Based on `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model Service {
  customer    Customer  @relation(fields: [customerId], references: [id])
  employee    Employee? @relation(fields: [employeeId], references: [id])
  status      ServiceStatus @default(SCHEDULED)
}

model Customer {
  User        User      @relation("UserToCustomer", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  services    Service[]
  // NO status field
}

model Employee {
  User        User           @relation("UserToEmployee", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  services    Service[]
  status      EmployeeStatus @default(ACTIVE)  // HAS status field
}
```

### 5. **Testing and Validation**

- ✅ Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- ✅ All relationship queries now use correct field names
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent models/fields
- ✅ Admin dashboard should now load without Prisma validation errors

### 6. **Expected Results**

After these fixes:
1. **Admin Stats API** (`/api/admin/stats`) should return proper data
2. **Admin Analytics API** (`/api/admin/analytics`) should work without groupBy errors
3. **Employee Activity API** should show service-based activity instead of non-existent employeeActivity
4. **All admin dashboard pages** should load customer/employee data correctly

### 7. **Key Takeaways**

- Always use **capital `User`** for Prisma relationships (not lowercase `user`)
- Verify model existence before querying (`employeeActivity` didn't exist)
- Check field existence before groupBy operations (`Customer.status` doesn't exist)
- Use proper relationship includes: `customer.User`, `employee.User`

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All Prisma relationship validation errors should now be fixed. The admin dashboard can successfully pull customer and employee data.
