### ðŸŽ¯ **What We Implemented**

I've successfully updated the employee/scooper job system to match your exact requirements:

---

## âœ… **YOUR REQUIREMENTS - ALL IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Jobs Unlock at 8 AM Daily** âœ…
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Jobs unlock exactly at 8 AM local time
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Customers pick preferred day of the week
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Jobs are locked until 8 AM for that specific day
- **TESTED**: System successfully unlocks jobs at 8 AM

### **2. Closest 10 Jobs Sorted by Miles** âœ…
- **IMPLEMENTED**: System shows closest 10 jobs to each scooper
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Jobs sorted by distance (miles) from scooper location
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Location-based filtering using GPS coordinates
- **TESTED**: System correctly limits to 10 closest jobs

### **3. Multiple Jobs Per Day, One Active at a Time** âœ…
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Scoopers can claim multiple jobs per day
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Only one job can be active (IN_PROGRESS) at a time
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Jobs are queued and processed sequentially
- **TESTED**: System allows multiple jobs but enforces one active limit

### **4. Rating-Based Queuing (4.5+ Stars)** âœ…
- **IMPLEMENTED**: 4.5+ star rating allows queuing additional jobs
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Lower rated employees must complete current job first

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Database Schema Updates**
- âœ… Added `claimedAt` timestamp for job claiming tracking
- âœ… Added `arrivalDeadline` for arrival time limits
- âœ… Added `isLocked`, `unlockedAt`, `lockExpiresAt` for job locking
- âœ… Added database indexes for performance

### **API Updates**
- âœ… Updated `available-services` API to show closest 10 jobs
- âœ… Updated job claiming API with rating-based queuing
- âœ… Fixed cron job to unlock at 8 AM local time
- âœ… Added distance calculation and sorting
- âœ… Added employee status tracking

### **Business Logic**
- âœ… **8 AM Unlock**: Jobs unlock at exactly 8 AM local time
- âœ… **Distance Sorting**: Jobs sorted by proximity to employee
- âœ… **Rating Queuing**: 4.5+ stars can queue multiple jobs
- âœ… **One Active**: Only one job can be IN_PROGRESS at a time
- âœ… **Service Area**: Jobs filtered by employee service areas
