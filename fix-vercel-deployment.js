/**
 * Vercel Deployment Fixes
 * 
 * This script documents all the changes needed to fix issues with Vercel deployment.
 * You don't need to execute this script - it's just a reference for what was fixed.
 * 
 * Issues fixed:
 * 
 * 1. TypeScript error in BatchDetailPage - fixed interface definition
 * 2. ServicePhotoUpload not found - created proper export in index.ts
 * 3. Prisma Edge Runtime errors - removed process.exit for Edge compatibility
 * 4. Authentication loop issues - updated refresh token handling to be more resilient
 * 
 * After these changes, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Make sure all your environment variables are properly set in Vercel:
 *    - DATABASE_URL: postgres://neondb_owner:npg_4Jp1QuMdbHzw@ep-wispy-firefly-a6dll41z-pooler.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
 *    - JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET (use the same values as in .env.local)
 *    - NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL (set to your Vercel deployment URL)
 * 
 * 2. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
 * 
 * 3. Redeploy on Vercel
